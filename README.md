# Selenium-Repo
Capstone Project-Testing an Ecommerce Site with Selenium
In this Selenium project, you will develop the Page Object Model framework and use it for buying a product on Flipkart. You will test the site for a search query like a Phone with the specific phone memory size requirement.
The product should be added to the cart, ensuring that shipping will be done to the entered address, and the site should proceed to the checkout page.
